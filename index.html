      A luxury good can be identified by comparing the demand for the good at one point in time against the demand for the good at a different point in time, with a different income level. When income goes up, demand for luxury goods goes up even more than income went up. When income goes down, demand for luxury goods go down even more than income went down.[3] For example, if income goes up 1%, and the demand for a product goes up 2%, then the product is a luxury good.
      This contrasts with basic goods, for which demand stays the same or decreases only slightly as income goes down.</p>
